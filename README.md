## 📖 Learning & Development
This project serves as my **first hands-on experience building a fully interactive portfolio**.  
While building it, I am actively learning JavaScript and experimenting with best practices for structure, interactivity, and design.

The goal is to grow this project alongside my skills, improving animations, responsiveness, and user experience over time.
