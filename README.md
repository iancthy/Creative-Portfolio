# Creative Portfolio

A personal web space built with **React**, combining code, design, and interaction.  
This project explores motion, layout, and modern front-end techniques through a creative portfolio experience.

## What this is
- A portfolio
- A playground for ideas
- A space for experimentation

## Built With
- React
- Framer Motion
- Modern CSS (or Tailwind CSS)

## Why
To showcase not only finished projects, but also the process, ideas, and experimentation behind them.  
This is also my **first hands-on project with React**, and I'm learning as I build it, improving structure, interactivity, and design along the way.
